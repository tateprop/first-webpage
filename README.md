My first Web Page as directed by ODIN!

Things i learnt 
1) if you have an * tag it overrides the normal flow of atributes from parent to child
so this is probs bas practice
2) throwing in a flex box is an easy solution to most problems but probably not the best practice
3) after i finished the header part i knew finishing the rest would not be a challenge but
im glad i stuck it out because i really got in the flow of it all
4) naming things is hard
5) I need to research responsive design "internetting is hard" has a chapter on this
6) I need to research the css/html pep8 equivalent

I got lazy on the formatting but its not the main deal
This overall was not so hard.
I want the next challenge!!
