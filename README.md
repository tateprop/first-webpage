My first Web Page as directed by ODIN!

Things i learnt 
1) if you have an * tag it overrides the normal flow of atributes from parent to child
so this is probs bas practice
2) throwing in a flex box is an easy solution to most problems but probably not the best practice
3) after i finished the header part i knew finishing the rest would not be a challenge but
im glad i stuck it out because i really got in the flow of it all
4) naming things is hard
5) I need to research responsive design "internetting is hard" has a chapter on this
6) I need to research the css/html pep8 equivalent

I got lazy on the formatting but its not the main deal
This overall was not so hard.
I want the next challenge!!

SO I'm putting some other stuff in this repo
I'm doing InternetingIsHard.

Firstly regarding the above
1) * tag should be used only for border-box and setting margin/ padding to 0
2) Resposive design is pretty cool
3) RD helps with margin values because you know approx the size of display
so you can set absolute values
 
Still to look into.
1) correct design princeples (when to use which tags etc.)
2) naming conventions
